# üìÇ SQL for Data Analysts 103: A Chinook Database Case Study
### ‚õ± This area showcases foundational SQL skills essential for data analysis, demonstrated through practical queries on the chinook.db database. 
**üåªselect data from multiple tables using 'WHERE' - 'PK = FK'**
```sql
SELECT * FROM artists, albums
WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId;
```
```sql
SELECT 
    A.ArtistId,
    A.Name   AS artist_name,
    B.Title  AS album_name
FROM artists AS A, albums AS B
WHERE A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId -- PK=FK
 AND A.Name LIKE 'C%';
```
**üåªconvert 'WHERE' to 'INNER JOIN'**
```sql
SELECT 
    A.ArtistId,
    A.Name   AS artistName,
    B.Title  AS albumName
FROM artists AS A
JOIN albums  AS B
ON A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId
WHERE A.Name LIKE 'C%';
```
```sql
-- Default JOIN = INNER JOIN
SELECT 
    A.ArtistId,
    A.Name   AS artistName,
    B.Title  AS albumName,
    C.Name   AS trackName
FROM artists AS A
JOIN albums  AS B
 ON A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId
JOIN tracks  AS C
 ON C.AlbumId = B.AlbumId
WHERE A.Name LIKE 'C%';
```
```sql
-- count song of 'Aerosmith'
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS Aerosmith_Songs
FROM artists AS A
JOIN albums  AS B
 ON A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId
JOIN tracks  AS C
 ON C.AlbumId = B.AlbumId
WHERE A.Name = 'Aerosmith';
```
**üåªreview type of JOIN**

**üåªreview create table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE book_shop (
	id INT,
    name TEXT,
  	release_year INT
);

CREATE TABLE favorite_book (
	id INT,
  	author TEXT,
  	reviews REAL
);

INSERT INTO book_shop VALUES
    (1, 'Think Like a Freak', 2014),
    (2, 'Ultralearning', 2019),
    (3, 'Blue Ocean Strategy', 2015),
    (4, 'The Power of Habit', 2012),
    (5, 'Outliers', 2008);
    
INSERT INTO favorite_book VALUES
    (1, 'Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner',1904),
    (4, 'Charles Duhigg', 12007),
    (5, 'Malcolm Gladwell', 12063);
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM book_shop;
SELECT * FROM favorite_book;
```
**üåªINNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN**
```sql
-- inner join
SELECT * FROM book_shop  As A
INNER JOIN favorite_book AS B  ON A.id = B.id;

-- the same result join with 'WHERE' clause
SELECT * FROM book_shop, favorite_book
WHERE book_shop.id = favorite_book.id;
```
```sql
-- left join
SELECT * FROM book_shop  AS A 
LEFT JOIN favorite_book  AS B ON A.id = B.id;
```
**üåªCROSS JOIN (aka. Cartesian)**

**üå∑cross join ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏°‡∏µ PK=FK (table x table)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM ranks;
SELECt * FROM suits;

-- cross join
SELECT * FROM ranks, suits;

-- ‡∏´‡∏£‡∏∑‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏Å‡πá‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ
SELECT * FROM ranks CROSS JOIN suits ORDER BY suit;
```
**üåªSelf join - table can join itself (self-join)**
```sql
-- CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    level TEXT,
    manager_id INT 
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES 
    (1, 'David', 'CEO', NULL),
    (2, 'John', 'SVP', 1),
    (3, 'Mary', 'VP', 2),
    (4, 'Adam', 'VP', 2),
    (5, 'Scott', 'Manager', 3),
    (6, 'Louise', 'Manager', 3),
    (7, 'Kevin', 'Manager', 4),
    (8, 'Takeshi', 'Manager', 4),
    (9, 'Joe', 'AM', 6),
    (10, 'Anna', 'AM', 7);
```
