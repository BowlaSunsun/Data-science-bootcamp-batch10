# üìÇ SQL for Data Analysts 101: A Chinook Database Case Study
### ‚õ± This area showcases foundational SQL skills essential for data analysis, demonstrated through practical queries on the chinook.db database. 
**üåªselect columns**
```sql
SELECT 
    firstname,
    lastname,
    country
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;
```
**üåªcreate new columns -> fullName & email**
```sql
SELECT 
    firstname,
    lastname,
    firstname || ' ' || lastname                                             AS fullName,
    LOWER(firstname) || '.'|| LOWER(SUBSTR(lastname,1,2)) || '@company.com'  AS email
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;
```

**üåªtransforming numeric data: minutes & mb**
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    ROUND(milliseconds / 60000.0, 2)   AS minute,
    ROUND(bytes / (1024*1024.0) , 2)   AS mb
FROM tracks;
```

**üåªcustomer segmentation: Corporate vs. End Customer**
```sql
-- CASE WHEN
SELECT 
    company,
    CASE 
    	WHEN company is not NULL THEN 'Corporate'
        ELSE 'End Customer'
    END AS segment
FROM customers;
```
**üåªworking with Date-Time in SQLite**
```sql
SELECT 
    invoicedate,
    STRFTIME('%Y', invoicedate)    AS year,
    STRFTIME('%m', invoicedate)    AS month,
    STRFTIME('%d', invoicedate)    AS day,
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m', invoicedate) AS monthid
FROM invoices
WHERE year = '2010';
```
```sql
SELECT 
    invoicedate,
    CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', invoicedate) AS INT)  AS year, -- ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ CAST ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ô data type
    STRFTIME('%m', invoicedate)               AS month,
    STRFTIME('%d', invoicedate)               AS day,
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m', invoicedate)            AS monthid
FROM invoices
WHERE year = 2011;
```
**üåªJOIN table: joining data across multiple tables: Artists, Albums, Tracks**
```sql
SELECT 
    ar.ArtistId,
    ar.name  AS artistName,
    al.Title AS albumTitle,
    tr.name  AS trackName,
    tr.Composer
FROM artists AS ar
JOIN albums  AS al
ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN tracks  AS tr
ON al.AlbumId = tr.AlbumId
WHERE ar.name = 'BackBeat';
```
**üåªgetting random rows**
```sql
-- Exploring Random Tracks
SELECT 
    name,
    RANDOM()
FROM tracks
ORDER By RANDOM() DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
```sql
-- ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏™‡πà RANDOM() ‡πÉ‡∏ô SELECT ‡∏Å‡πá‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ
SELECT 
    name
FROM tracks
ORDER By RANDOM() DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
