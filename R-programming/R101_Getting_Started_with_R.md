# 🌻 R101 Getting Started with R programming 
**📝 This section provides an overview of my foundational knowledge in R programming. It includes practical code examples and their outputs from the lessons learned.**
## 🍁 create variables
```r
income <- 50000
expense <- 30000
saving <- income - expense
```
## 🍁 remove variables 
```r
rm(saving)
```
## 🍁 compare values 
```r
1 + 1 == 2
2 * 2 <= 4
5 >= 10
5 - 2 != 3 ## not equal
10 < 2
10 > 2
```
## 🌻 data types 📑
### 🍁 1. numeric
```r
age <- 25
print(age)
class(age)

----
result:
> age <- 25
> print(age)
[1] 25
> class(age)
[1] "numeric"
```
